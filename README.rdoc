The Popcorn Engine is an escalation management web app that allows people in support roles to automate the process of deciding who has to take escalations to the team by leadership for special reasons. The app tracks who has done what and assigns a "rank" to all participants. When they take an escalation, their rank increments. When a new escalation comes in, it will only pool the members of the lowest rank available for random selection. This ensures that no one is free from the responsibility and prevents only one person from taking all the escalations.
